            <p>James Christopher Gaffigan (born July 7, 1966) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and producer. He was
            raised in Chesterton, Indiana. His material is often about fatherhood, observations, laziness, and food. He is also
            regarded as a "clean" comic, using little profanity in his routines. He has had several successful comedy specials,
            including Mr. Universe, Obsessed, and Cinco, all three of which received Grammy nominations.</p>
            <p>His memoir,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dad-Fat-Jim-Gaffigan/dp/0385349076" id="tribute-link" target="_blank"> Dad Is Fat (2013)</a> and his most recent book, Food: A Love Story (2014), are both published by Crown
            Publishers. He co-created and starred in a TV Land television series based on his life called The Jim Gaffigan Show. He
            collaborates extensively with his wife, actress Jeannie Gaffigan,[1] and together they have five children. They are
            Catholic, a topic that comes up in his comedy, and live in Manhattan, New York City.

            <p>Gaffigan was born on July 7, 1966[2] in Elgin, Illinois,[3] the son of Marcia Mitchell and Michael A. Gaffigan.[1] He
            grew up in Chesterton, Indiana, the youngest of six children, and often jokes about growing up in a large family.[4] His
            mother Marcia was a charity worker and fundraiser; she was also accomplished at needlework, for which she received a
            national award for original design and craftsmanship from the American Needlepoint Guild in 1985.[5] She died of cancer
            in 1990, aged 53.[5]</p>

            <p>His father Michael, a banker, was the president and CEO of the Mercantile National Bank of Indiana for fifteen years
            until his retirement in 1991.[6] A former seminarian, he was also actively involved in local charity work.[7] He died of
            lung cancer in 1999.[7] Gaffigan's father was the first in his family to attend college[8] and he encouraged his
            children to seek careers that promised job security.[9] However, at about the age of five, Jim announced that when he
            grew up, he wanted to be an "actor."[10]</p>

            <p>As a teenager, Gaffigan watched Saturday Night Live.[8] He attended La Lumiere School in La Porte, Indiana, where he
            starred on the school's football team. He attended Purdue University for one year, where he was a member of the Phi
            Gamma Delta Fraternity, then transferred to Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, where he graduated in
            1988 with a degree in Finance.[9][11][12] He played varsity football at Georgetown and Purdue.[13][14] Although Gaffigan
            had hated studying finance, he worked as a litigation consultant for a short time after graduating and "was horrible at
            it".[15]</p>

            <p>Gaffigan is married to actress Jeannie Gaffigan (n√©e Noth),[9] with whom he has five children: daughters Marre (born
            2004) and Katie Louise (born 2009) and sons Jack (born 2005), Michael (born 2011), and Patrick (born 2012). The family
            of seven famously lived in a two-bedroom apartment in New York City,[77] before moving to a larger home in 2015. To stay
            connected to his family, Gaffigan tries to "maintain bedtime rituals while working in the city";[19] when on tour, he
            reportedly takes his family with him. Gaffigan has stated that he avoids working on Sundays.[19]</p>
            <p>Gaffigan has stated, on stage and elsewhere, that he is a practicing Catholic.[78][79][80] He and his family attend Mass
            at the Basilica of St. Patrick's Old Cathedral in Manhattan, where Gaffigan and his wife Jeannie were married in 2003
            and where their children were baptized.[81][82][83] In May 2016, the Gaffigans delivered the commencement address at the
            Catholic University of America.[84] The Gaffigans also delivered the commencement address at Jeannie's alma mater
            Marquette University on 20 May 2018. They were both awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree as part of the
            graduation ceremony.[85]</p>
            <p>In April 2017, Jeannie was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor known as papilloma of the choroid plexus, which was
            successfully removed in a nine-hour surgery performed by Dr. Joshua B. Bederson.[86][87]</p>
